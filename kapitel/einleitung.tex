Refer to equations using the following way. In equation (\ref{eq:sum}) we can replace $G(x)$. As seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:logo}, however, the referred object always needs to come before the corresponding text. We can refer to literature \cite{schlatter_orlu_2010} as an important citation \citep[see for instance][and others]{schlatter_orlu_2010}.
