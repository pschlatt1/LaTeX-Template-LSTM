### LaTeX template for project theses at LSTM-FAU

Please use this template for any project thesis (Master, Bachelor, ...) at LSTM. The title page is in Word, and has to be manually adapted, and converted to pdf. For the digital version of the thesis, use the title page with blue background, to print the one with the white background.

For thesis work done in Word, try to match the format as closely as possible. The preferred language is English, but there are also German versions available.

The Tech. Rep. number (e.g. 01/2025) you can get from the LSTM Administration.

This template is based on previous work by Chris Heigl and Felix Czwielong, and other colleagues.

In case of improvements, please issue PRs to keep these sources up to date.
